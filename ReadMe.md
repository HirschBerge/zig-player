# Zig Player

## Vision
It's not going to be an actual video player or anything. Probably just MPV.
### Core Features
I want it to replace my [yt script](https://github.com/HirschBerge/Public-dots/blob/6637b5845ac1d88f7d75b11905e2c7e311b38e13/nixos/common/scripts.nix#L79). I'd like to incorporate a few things.

- History: Probably just stored in a json in $XDG_CACHE_HOME
- Replay/queue items from history.
- Notifications
- Quick rewatch last
- Show mpv queue
- Maybe have built-in queue in case I want to support other players such as vlc?
